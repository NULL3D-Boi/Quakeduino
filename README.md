# Quakeduino
A mod of a 3d raycast engine for Arduino

![](/images/screen-1.jpg)

I liked the original project and for some reason I wanted it to be Quake.

To be clear. **This is not an actual Quake game**, just picked some sprites from it (and simplified a lot). The rendering engine is more like a Wolfeistein 3D. The Quake idea came because I like Auake and I wanted to make it Quake.

Hardware I used:
- 2 mini breadboards
- An "Arduino" nano V3 (ATmega328P)
- An OLED Display (i2c 128x64)
- 5 buttons
- A crap ton of wires

Resources:
- Sprites from https://www.spriters-resource.com
- Much thanks to https://lodev.org/cgtutor for so wonderful resource about raycasting engines

Current status:
- Basically just a skin with a few tweaked values

(I'd like) To do:
- Try to add multiple levels
- Try to add more guns
- Try to add more enemies
